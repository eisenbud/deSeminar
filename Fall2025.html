        Hai Long Dao and I were surprised to discover (first experimentally) that over a Golod ring, some sequence of syzygy modules of \(k\) contain \(k\) as a direct summand, and we gave a complete family of examples of the possible sequences. To do this we needed to understand a natural minimal \(S\)-free resolution of \(I^2\) when \(I\) is generated by a regular sequence. 

        In this talk I'll explain this problem and its solution using a simple part  of the representation theory of the general linear group.

The classical Brill--Noether theorem (established by work of Eisenbud, Fulton, Geiseker, Griffiths, Harris, Lazarsfeld) describes the geometry of this space of maps when C is a general curve. However, the theorem fails for special curves, notably curves that are already equipped with some unexpected map to a projective space. The first case of this is when C is a low-degree cover of the projective line. For general such covers, the Hurwitz--Brill--Noether theorem (joint with E. Larson and I. Vogt) provides a suitable analogue. I'll also present results (joint with S. Vemulapalli) regarding the next natural case: when C is equipped with an embedding in the projective plane.

surface in \(P4\) is bounded. This conjectured was answered positively by
Ellingsrud and Peskine (1989): There only finitely many components of
the Hilbert scheme of surfaces in \(P4\), whose general element correspond
to a smooth surface, which is not of general type.

Around that time there was a flourish of activities to construct and
classify such surfaces, e.g. by Okonek, Ranestad,
Decker-Ein-Schreyer, Popescu, Abo. The existence proofs in [DES] used
Macaulay (classic) in an essential way. Now more then 25 years later,
Macaulay2 is much faster and we should be able to go further.

In the talk I will explain our three basic construction methods:

Hilbert-Burch morphism with vector bundles

random searches over finite fields

Tate resolutions

and will illustrate each of these techniques in striking examples.</span></p>

        <p class="p6"><span class="s2">A structural equation model (SEM) is a multivariate statistical model that is determined by a so-called mixed graph. Nodes in the mixed graph model random variables. A mixed graph contains two types of edges, directed ones, which model direct dependencies between the random variables, and bidirected ones, which model hidden correlations. When the random variables are normally distributed and the dependencies are linear (a so-called linear SEM), then the covariances between the random variables are rational functions of the parameters that are associated to the edges of the mixed graph. In the first part of the talk with give a gentle introduction to the topic and explain how linear SEMs give rise to interesting questions in polynomial equation solving.
<br/>
        To distinguish correlation from causation, we want to determine whether the observed covariances  uniquely determine the hidden parameters. A linear SEM is called generically identifiable, if the rational map that maps the parameters of the SEM to the observed covariances between the random variables is generically injective. The complexity of deciding whether a given SEM is generically identifiable is open. In this talk, we present a randomized polynomial time algorithm for the case when the directed edges of the SEM form a tree.

        In 1822 Jean-Victor Poncelet stated a remarkable fact: given two conics, there are infinitely many polygons are inscribed by one and circumscribed about the other, or none at all. The result, known as Poncelet’s Porism, marked the beginning of complex projective geometry. A recurring theme in the following decades was enumerating the in-and-circumscribed polygons between two plane curves. Early on, two approaches of varying success became apparent, the theory of correspondences (Cayley) and a calculus of conditions (Schubert). In the 80’s, Collino and Fulton revisited the case of triangles from the perspective of modern intersection theory. As they demonstrate, the presence of singularities has an unusual impact on the overall count. In this talk, we continue their investigation, discovering a curious plane curve singularity invariant along the way. Attendees can expect excursions into history and Macaulay2, all with a classic flavor of enumerative geometry. </span></p>

In this talk, I will explain which splitting loci, as algebraic stacks, are Gorenstein or \(\mathbb{Q}\)-Gorenstein. There are two main ingredients. One is an intersection-theoretic computation of class groups of splitting loci in certain affine extension spaces. The other is an explicit understanding of the normal bundle of an open dense substack of splitting loci, yielding a formula for the class of their canonical module.</span></p>

Read conjectured that the absolute values of the coefficients of a chromatic polynomial form a unimodal sequence. This conjecture is a special case of the broader Rota-Heron-Welsh conjecture regarding the log-concavity of the characteristic polynomial of matroids. June Huh discovered a critical link between matroids and algebraic geometry, leading to the proof of these two conjectures. In this talk, I'll explain the proof of Read's conjecture, and if time permits, outline the strategies and techniques required to approach the more general Rota-Heron-Welsh conjecture.</span></p>
