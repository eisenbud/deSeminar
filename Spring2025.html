        <td>
	  The King Conjecture proposed that every toric variety has a full, strong exceptional collection of line bundles. While the conjecture turned out to be false, it has continued to inspire a huge amount of research on derived categories of toric varieties.  I will explain how King’s Conjecture can be remedied, and proven, if one incorporates a birational geometry perspective.

Let \(C\) be a general rational curve of degree $d$ in a Grassmannian \(G(k, n)\). The natural expectation is that its normal
bundle is balanced, i.e., isomorphic to \(\bigoplus \mathcal{O}(e_i)\) with all
\(|e_i - e_j| \leq 1\). In this talk, I will describe several
counterexamples to this expectation, propose a suitably revised
conjecture, and describe recent progress towards this conjecture.

        <th>Borel-Weil Theory through Examples</th>
        <td>Let \(V\) be the standard representation of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})\) acting on \(\mathbb{C}^2\). 
            One of the first theorems proved in a Lie theory course is that all the irreducible representations of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})\) are given by the symmetric powers \(V(n) := \operatorname{Sym}^n(V)\). 
            \(V(n)\) is the vector space of homogeneous degree \(n\) polynomials in \(2\) variables; this is also the global sections of the holomorphic line bundle \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) on \(\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1\)!
            <br>
            This is the simplest example of Borel-Weil-Bott theory, which says all representations of complex semisimple Lie groups arise from the cohomology of holomorphic line bundles on a space constructed from the Lie group. 
            I will review just enough Lie theory to state this, explain the construction, and do some simple examples.</td>

        <td>Given a projective variety \(X\), it is always covered by curves obtained by taking the intersection with a linear subspace. We study whether there exist curves on \(X\) that have smaller numerical invariants than those of the linear slices. If \(X\) is a general complete intersection of large degrees, we show that there are no curves on \(X\) of smaller degree, nor are there curves of asymptotically smaller gonality. This verifies a folklore conjecture on the degrees of subvarieties of complete intersections as well as a conjecture of Bastianelli--De Poi--Ein--Lazarsfeld--Ullery on measures of irrationality for complete intersections. This is joint work with Nathan Chen and Junyan Zhao.</td>

        <td>In this talk, I will discuss new bounds on constrained sets of fractions. Specifically, I will discuss the answer to the following question, which arises in several areas of number theory: for an integer \(k \ge 2\), consider the set of \(k\)-tuples of reduced fractions \(\frac{a_1}{q_1}, \dots, \frac{a_k}{q_k} \in I\), where \(I\) is an interval around \(0\).
        How many \(k\)-tuples are there with \(\sum_i \frac{a_i}{q_i} \in \mathbb Z\)?
        
        When \(k\) is even, the answer is well-known: the main contribution to the number of solutions comes from ``diagonal'' terms, where the fractions \(\frac{a_i}{q_i}\) cancel in pairs. When \(k\) is odd, the answer is much more mysterious! In work with Bloom, we prove a near-optimal upper bound on this problem when \(k\) is odd. I will also discuss applications of this problem to estimating moments of the distributions of primes and reduced residues.</td>

We show that a family of polynomial rings graded by an abelian monoid supports a Stillman bound if and only if the monoid has bounded factorization. I will discuss our proof, along with extensions of Erman-Sam-Snowden's ultraproduct techniques to monoid-graded algebras. This is joint work with John Cobb (Auburn) and John Spoerl (UW Madison).</td>

We will use a result of Gabber on the cohomology of Henselian pairs to deduce the equivalence of the two definitions. If time permits, we will discuss an example of a weakly étale morphism which does not lift along a surjective ring map. This is joint work with Johan de Jong.</td>

        <th>Classifying numerical semigroups using polyhedral geometry</th>
        <td>A numerical semigroup is a subset of the natural numbers that is closed under addition.  There is a family of polyhedral cones \(C_m\), called Kunz cones, for which each numerical semigroup with smallest positive element m corresponds to an integer point in \(C_m\).  It has been shown that if two numerical semigroups correspond to points in the same face of \(C_m\), they share many important properties, such as the number of minimal generators and the Betti numbers of their defining toric ideals.  In this way, the faces of the Kunz cones naturally partition the set of all numerical semigroups into "cells" within which any two numerical semigroups have similar algebraic structure.  

        In this talk, we discuss how studying Kunz cones can inform the classification of numerical semigroups, using complete intersection numerical semigroups as a case study.  No familiarity with numerical semigroups or polyhedral geometry will be assumed for this talk.  </td>

        <td>Some 40 years ago, Faltings proved the remarkable theorem that a curve of geometric genus \(g > 1\) over a number field \(K\) can have only finitely many rational points over \(K\). This immediately gave rise to two follow-up questions. First, we can ask if the number is bounded in terms of \(g\) and \(K\). And second, we can ask if there is an analogue of Faltings' theorem for higher-dimensional varieties. In this talk, I'll describe what is conjectured about these questions, as well as an unexpected connection between the two.</td>

            on the Grassmannian \(\text{Gr}(r,N)\). The Quot scheme over a smooth curve \(C\) provides a compactification for the space of morphisms from \(C\) to \(\text{Gr}(r,N)\). The (virtual) intersection theory of Quot, as studied by Oprea and Marian, recovers the Vafa-Intriligator formula that counts the number of maps from \(C\) to \(\text{Gr}(r,N)\). In this talk, I present formulas for Euler characteristics of vector bundles over the Quot schemes of curves, offering a K-theoretic analogue of the Vafa-Intriligator formula. This is based on joint works with Dragos Oprea and with Ming Zhang.</td>

I describe some examples of Springer fibers geometrically, and then I show that the Springer fiber at \(x\) is equidimensional with irreducible components in one-to-one correspondence with standard Young tableaux of shape \(\lambda\). Afterwards, I will interpret the operations of Robinson-Schensted row-insertion, Schützenberger involution, and jeu de taquin, geometrically via the components of Springer fibers. These may be viewed as combinatorial shadows of the celebrated Springer correspondence: a relation between the cohomology of Springer fibers and the irreducible representations of \(S_n\).</td>

I will describe the work of Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin, and Manin on the construction of a special family of solutions in terms of linear algebra. Algebro-geometric results of Horrocks and Barth are key ingredients.</td>

In this expository talk, I will attempt to explain how this surprising phenomenon should actually be viewed as a shadow of Serre duality, and sketch the relationship of polytopes with toric varieties that explains how algebraic geometry enters the picture. </td>

            <br>
        In this talk we'll define the Segre determinant and compute some examples in various coordinate systems. We will also see how it arises in nature: first in algebraic vision, and then as the Chow-Lam form of a torus orbit in the Grassmannian. These Chow-Lam forms were introduced as a generalization of Chow forms for projective varieties, and enjoy many similar properties.</td>

We study the critical loci of all Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces. These loci form an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence. We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the bihomogeneous prime ideal of this variety.</td>

You can also (but I won't) think of \(\text{reg}(M)\) as recording information about the vanishing of local cohomology modules. Instead, we will observe that in certain cases of interest, computing reg(M) reduces to a combinatorics problem on various flavors of Grothendieck polynomials, which are already well-studied in algebraic combinatorics for their applications to K-theoretic Schubert calculus. In joint works with David Speyer, Matthew St.Denis, and Anna Weigandt, we tackle these combinatorics problems and extract new formulas and bounds for the regularities of families of ideals generated by determinants and Pfaffians.</td>

The strata that arise are called splitting loci. In this talk, I will construct a modular resolution of singularities for each splitting locus. Using Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory, this construction recovers the classical Gieseker-Petri theorem that for a general curve of genus \(g\), \(G^r_d\) is smooth. If time permits, I will also outline how to use this construction to prove that certain tame splitting loci have rational singularities. As a corollary, we prove that components of the Brill-Noether variety \(W^r_d\) for a general \(k\)-gonal curve have rational singularities.
