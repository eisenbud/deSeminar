        <td>
	  The King Conjecture proposed that every toric variety has a full, strong exceptional collection of line bundles. While the conjecture turned out to be false, it has continued to inspire a huge amount of research on derived categories of toric varieties.  I will explain how Kingâ€™s Conjecture can be remedied, and proven, if one incorporates a birational geometry perspective.

        <td>
Let \(C\) be a general rational curve of degree $d$ in a Grassmannian \(G(k, n)\). The natural expectation is that its normal
bundle is balanced, i.e., isomorphic to \(\bigoplus \mathcal{O}(e_i)\) with all
\(|e_i - e_j| \leq 1\). In this talk, I will describe several
counterexamples to this expectation, propose a suitably revised
conjecture, and describe recent progress towards this conjecture.

        <td>Let \(V\) be the standard representation of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})\) acting on \(\mathbb{C}^2\). 
            One of the first theorems proved in a Lie theory course is that all the irreducible representations of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})\) are given by the symmetric powers \(V(n) := \operatorname{Sym}^n(V)\). 
            \(V(n)\) is the vector space of homogeneous degree \(n\) polynomials in \(2\) variables; this is also the global sections of the holomorphic line bundle \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) on \(\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1\)!
            <br>
            This is the simplest example of Borel-Weil-Bott theory, which says all representations of complex semisimple Lie groups arise from the cohomology of holomorphic line bundles on a space constructed from the Lie group. 
            I will review just enough Lie theory to state this, explain the construction, and do some simple examples.</td>

        <th>Curves on complete intersections and measures of irrationality</th>
        <td>Given a projective variety \(X\), it is always covered by curves obtained by taking the intersection with a linear subspace. We study whether there exist curves on \(X\) that have smaller numerical invariants than those of the linear slices. If \(X\) is a general complete intersection of large degrees, we show that there are no curves on \(X\) of smaller degree, nor are there curves of asymptotically smaller gonality. This verifies a folklore conjecture on the degrees of subvarieties of complete intersections as well as a conjecture of Bastianelli--De Poi--Ein--Lazarsfeld--Ullery on measures of irrationality for complete intersections. This is joint work with Nathan Chen and Junyan Zhao.</td>
