		<th>Taylor Polynomials of Rational Functions</th>
		<td>A Taylor variety consists of all fixed order Taylor polynomials of rational functions, where the number of variables and degrees of numerators and denominators are fixed. In one variable, this leads us to Padé approximation and rank constraints on Hankel matrices. We study the dimension and defining ideals of Taylor varieties. In three and more variables, there exist defective Taylor varieties, and we explain this with Fröberg's Conjecture in commutative algebra. This is joint work with Aldo Conca, Simone Naldi and Giorgio Ottaviani.</td>

		<th>The relationship between scrollar invariants of curves and successive minima of orders in number fields, and related counting problems</th>
		<td>Let \( n \geq 2 \) be an integer. To a degree \( n \) cover of \( \mathbb P^1 \), we may attach \( n-1 \) integers called the scrollar invariants. Similarly, to an order in a degree \( n \) number field, we may attach \( n-1 \) real numbers called the successive minima. In this talk I will explain the relationship between scrollar invariants of curves and successive minima of orders in number fields. Surprisingly, we don't know the answers to many fundamental questions about these invariants.

			In this talk, I prove bounds on these invariants. When \( n < 6 \), I'll also discuss a related counting question: how many orders in degree \( n \) number fields are there with bounded discriminant and prescribed successive minima? If time permits, we will also discuss some partial results on which scrollar invariants arise from smooth curves.</td>

			<th>Extensions of varieties, the adjunction process for surfaces and maximal extensions of paracanonical curves of genus 6.</th>
			<td>Let \( X \) be a subvariety of \( \mathbb P^n \). An \( e \)-extension \( Y \) is a subvariety of \( \mathbb P^{n+e} \), which is not a cone,
such that there exists a regular sequence \( y_1,\ldots,y_e \) of linear forms for the homogeneous coordinate ring \( S_Y \) of \( Y \) 
such that \( S_Y/(y_1,\ldots,y_e) = S_X \) is the coordinate ring of \( X \).

In this talk I will discribe a computationally easy to use method to compute maximal extensions of certain varieties and illustrate this method by describing maximal extensions of paracanonical curves \( C \) of genus 6.

A paracanonical curve is a curve embedded by a line bundle \( \mathscr L \), which  differs from the canonical bundle
by a topologically trivial line bundle \( \eta \), i.e, an \( \eta \) in \( \operatorname{Pic}^0(C) \). In case of genus 6, the general ones are curves of degree 10 in \( \mathbb P^4 \) with a cubic linear resolution \( S \leftarrow S^{10}(-3) \leftarrow S^{15}(-4) \leftarrow S^6(-5) \leftarrow 0 \).
To identify the smooth 1-extensions \( Y \) in \( \mathbb P^5 \) of \( C \)  we use the adjunction process of Sommese and Van de Ven for surfaces.</td>

		<td>In joint work with Michael DeBellevue, we give extensions of results of Dao and Eisenbud showing the existence of direct summands isomorphic to the residue field in all high syzygies of any module whenever the ring satisfies a certain condition. This implies that some amount of linearity is always present in the resolutions. Our method of proof is via the relative bar resolution of Iyengar and gives some idea of why these summands should exist in such abundance and why they appear from a certain degree onward. In addition, we go on to find an exponential number of these explicitly in the Golod setting using instead the bar resolution formed from A-infinity resolutions due to Burke.</td>

		<th>Cohomology of moduli spaces of curves</th>
		<td>The moduli space \( M_g \) of genus g curves (or Riemann surfaces) is a central object of study in algebraic geometry. Its cohomology is important in many fields. For example, the cohomology of \( M_g \) is the same as the cohomology of the mapping class group, and is also related to spaces of modular forms. Using its properties as a moduli space, Mumford defined a distinguished subring of the cohomology of \( M_g \) called the tautological ring. The definition of the tautological ring was later extended to the compactification \( \overline{M_g} \) and the moduli spaces with marked points \( \overline{M_{g,n}} \). While the full cohomology ring of \( \overline{M_{g,n}} \) is quite mysterious, the tautological subring is relatively well understood, and conjecturally completely understood. In this talk, I'll ask the question: which cohomology groups \( H^k(\overline{M_{g,n}}) \) are tautological? And when they are not, how can we better understand them? This is joint work with Samir Canning and Sam Payne.</td>

		<th>The embedding theorem in Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory</th>
		<td> Abstract: Brill-Noether theory studies the maps of general curves to projective
spaces. The embedding theorem of Eisenbud and Harris states that a
general degree \(d\) map \(C\) to \(\mathbb P^r\) is an embedding when \(r\) is at least 3.
Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory starts with a curve \(C\) already equipped
with a fixed map \(C\) to \(\mathbb P^1\) (which often forces \(C\) to be special) and
then studies the maps of \(C\) to other projective spaces. In this
setting, the appropriate analogue of the invariants \(d\) and \(r\) is a finer
invariant called the splitting type. Our embedding theorem determines
the splitting types \(\vec{e}\) such that a general map of splitting type
\(\vec{e}\) is an embedding. This is joint work with Kaelin Cook-Powel,
Dave Jensen, Eric Larson, and Isabel Vogt.</td>

		<th>Weyman's generic free resolutions of length three</th>

<td>One approach to studying the structure of finite free resolutions is to construct and analyze universal examples. Unfortunately, Bruns proved that these examples typically do not exist---but they do if one weakens the standard notion of universality to allow for non-unique specialization. Weyman constructed such "generic" examples for length three resolutions, with a careful handling of this non-uniqueness. Moreover, this apparent defect of the construction actually endows the generic example with additional symmetry, from which a surprising connection to the ADE classification arises. I'll explain how this extra symmetry can be leveraged to better understand Weyman's generic example, and some of its applications to linkage and the structure theory of perfect ideals.

In this talk, I will first talk about how and why people use derived categories in algebraic geometry and then I will briefly explain how we can indeed define derived categories. Then, as an example, we will explore the derived category on an elliptic curve. If time permits, I will also compare it with the derived category on a projective line.</td>

		<th>On the maximum genus of space curves</th>
		<td>The study of space curves goes well back into the 19th century, with the great papers of Max Noether and Georges Halphen in 1882. The determination of all possible pairs \((d,g)\) of degree and genus of space curves was correctly stated by Halphen in his paper, but not proved until the work of Gruson and Peskine in 1982. I will focus on just one part of this problem, namely, what is the maximum genus of a space curve of degree \(d\)? In its unadorned form, this question has a simple answer, but when you add consideration of the degree of a surface containing the curve, it is more complicated, and still not completely known. I will discuss the current state of this problem, also known as Halphen’s problem.</td>

		<th>Gorenstein ideals of codimension four</th>
		<td>The structure of Gorenstein ideals of codimension three is described by the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud structure theorem. In codimension four, there is a mostly settled conjecture that such an ideal of deviation two (the simplest non-trivial case) is a hypersurface section of one in codimension three. But such ideals with more generators remain mysterious. Unlike in codimension three, these ideals need not be in the linkage class of a complete intersection (licci). Kustin conjectured that the licci property could be detected by a sequence of "higher order products" generalizing the multiplication on the free resolution of such an ideal, but he only defined a few of these products. I will explain a conjecture, coming from Weyman's work on generic resolutions, that gives a new perspective on the preceding ideas. Then I will explain how similar ideas have been used to investigate previously unexplored territory in codimension three.</td>

		<th>Symmetries on derived categories and reconstruction of elliptic curves</th>

In this talk, we will discuss a version of reconstruction of elliptic curves that was announced this year, using symmetry of derived categories coming from their autoequivalences. Moreover, if time permits, we will see possible generalization and obstructions to higher dimensional cases, which were discussed in my recent paper in relation with monoidal structures on derived categories.</td>

		<th>Measures of irrationality for hypersurfaces of large degree</th>
		<td>Determining whether a variety is rational is a classical and longstanding problem in birational geometry. A paper by Bastianelli et al. proposes a different angle to this question by considering various measures of irrationality that quantify how far a variety is from being rational. Under this framework, rather than asking whether a variety is rational, it makes sense to ask: what are the values of these measures of irrationality of a variety?
I will outline the proof of the following result of Bastianelli et al.: Let \( \mathrm{irr}(X) \) denote the least degree of dominant rational maps \( X \) to \( \mathbb P^{\dim X} \). Then for \( X \) a very general smooth hypersurface in \( \mathbb P^{n+1} \) of degree \( d \geq 2n+1 \), the irrationality degree \( \mathrm{irr}(X) \) is \( d-1 \), and any rational map achieving the irrationality degree is given by projection from a point if \( d \geq 2n+2 \). This recovers a theorem of M. Noether about the gonality of smooth plane curves. 
The key insight is that positivity of the canonical bundle and Mumford's technique of induced differentials allows us to say the fibers of a dominant map to \( \mathbb P^n \) must lie on a line, which converts the problem to a study of first order line congruences in \( \mathbb P^{n+1} \). In the case of surfaces in \( \mathbb P^3 \) and threefolds in \( \mathbb P^4 \), an earlier paper of Bastianelli, Cortini and de Poi characterizes explicitly which hypersurfaces are not very general in this sense. If time permits, I will also discuss some open problems related to this circle of ideas. We work over the complex numbers throughout.</td>

		<th>Permutohedral complexes and curves with cyclic action</th>
		<td>Although the moduli space of genus-zero curves is not toric, it shares an intriguing amount of the combinatorial structure that a toric variety would enjoy. In fact, by adjusting the moduli problem slightly, one finds a moduli space that is indeed toric, known as Losev—Manin space. The associated polytope is the permutohedron, which has a wealth of other connections: notably, to the structure of the symmetric group and to the combinatorics of matroids. Batyrev and Blume generalized this story by constructing a type-B version of Losev—Manin space whose associated polytope is a signed permutohedron that relates to the group of signed permutations and the combinatorics of delta-matroids. I will discuss joint work with C. Damiolini, C. Eur, D. Huang, S. Li, and R. Ramadas in which we carry out the next stage of generalization, defining a family of moduli spaces of rational curves with \( \mathbb{Z}_r \)-action that can be encoded by a "permutohedral complex" for a more general complex reflection group, and which relates to the combinatorics of multimatroids.</td>

Over the years, this statement has been generalized a number of times; the subject of this talk will be describing and proving the much stronger Bruns-Eisenbud-Evans Principal Ideal Theorem. In addition, we will recall the fundamentals of determinantal ideals, ideals generated by the \( t \times t \) minors of an \( m \times n \) matrix over \( R \), and discuss Bruns’ sharpening of the Eagon-Northcott bound in the special case \( I_t(\phi) \neq R \) with \( I_{t+1}(\phi) = 0\).</td>
