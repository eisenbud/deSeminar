I will explain this structure theorem and give many examples along the way.</th>

		<th>Reconstructing schemes from their étale topoi</th>
		<td>In Grothendieck’s 1983 letter to Faltings that initiated the study of anabelian geometry, he conjectured that a large class of schemes can be reconstructed from their étale topoi. In this talk, I’ll explain a number of formulations of Grothendieck’s conjecture, and how one might come to make this conjecture. I’ll also discuss joint work with Magnus Carlson and Sebastian Wolf, generalizing work of Voevodsky, that proves Grothendieck’s conjecture. Specifically, we show that over a finitely generated field k of characteristic 0, seminormal finite type k-schemes can be reconstructed from their étale topoi. Over a finitely generated field k of positive characteristic and transcendence degree \(\geq 1\), we show that perfections of finite type k-schemes can be reconstructed from their étale topoi. </th>

I will describe joint work with Yibo Gao in which we resolve a conjecture of Billey-Postnikov by quantifying these singularities by determining the first homological degree in which Poincare duality fails. Equivalently, this determines the smallest power of \(q\) appearing in a Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial. Our methods rely on the combinatorics of permutation patterns. I'll also explain how this can be combined with my other work on generic torus orbit closures in Schubert varieties in order to determine when these are smooth, thereby proving a conjecture of Lee-Masuda-Park.</th>

		<th>A new proof of the Bondal-Orlov reconstruction theorem</th>
		<td>In 1997, Bondal and Orlov showed that a smooth (anti-)Fano variety \(X\) can be reconstructed from the triangulated category structure of its derived category. On the other hand, in 2004, Balmer showed that any variety \(X\) can be reconstructed from its derived category together with the monoidal structure given by the derived tensor product. This indicates that for a smooth (anti-)Fano variety, Balmer's reconstruction should be able to be done without actually using the monoidal structure and from this perspective, we will provide a new proof of the Bondal-Orlov reconstruction theorem. Furthermore, we offer new insights and institutions on derived categories from the techniques we developed as well as generalizations of several other reconstruction theorems.</th>

As n grows relative to g, work of Casnati, Barros--Mullane, and Schwarz shows that \(\mathcal{H}_{g,n}\) goes from being rational (the simplest kind of variety) to general type (quite complicated). This suggests that we have hope of probing finer invariants of \(\mathcal{H}_{g,n}\) when \(n\) is small relative to \(g\). The Chow ring of \(\mathcal{H}_{g,n}\) is one such invariant. I will describe an inductive procedure for stratifying \(\mathcal{H}_{g,n}\) into nice pieces, which allows us to calculate its rational Chow ring when \(n\) is less than or equal to \(2g + 6\). This is joint work with Samir Canning.</th>

		<th>Homological Mirror Symmetry for Theta Divisors</th>
		<td>Symplectic geometry is a relatively new branch of geometry. However, a string theory-inspired duality known as “mirror symmetry” reveals more about symplectic geometry from its mirror counterparts in complex geometry. M. Kontsevich conjectured an algebraic version of mirror symmetry called “homological mirror symmetry” (HMS) in his 1994 ICM address. HMS results were then proved for symplectic mirrors to Calabi-Yau and Fano manifolds. Those mirror to general type manifolds have been studied in more recent years, including my research. In this talk, we will introduce HMS through the example of the 2-torus \(T^2\). We will then outline how it relates to HMS for a hypersurface of a 4-torus \(T^4\) and generalize to hypersurfaces of higher dimensional tori, otherwise known as “theta divisors.” This is joint work with Haniya Azam, Heather Lee, and Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu.</th>

In one variable, this leads us to Padé approximation and rank constraints on Hankel matrices. We study the dimension and defining ideals of Taylor varieties. In three and more variables, there exist defective Taylor varieties, and we explain this with Fröberg's Conjecture in commutative algebra.

Similarly, to an order in a degree \( n \) number field, we may attach \( n-1 \) real numbers called the successive minima. In this talk I will explain the relationship between scrollar invariants of curves and successive minima of orders in number fields. Surprisingly, we don't know the answers to many fundamental questions about these invariants.

			In this talk, I prove bounds on these invariants. When \( n < 6 \), I'll also discuss a related counting question: how many orders in degree \( n \) number fields are there with bounded discriminant and prescribed successive minima? If time permits, we will also discuss some partial results on which scrollar invariants arise from smooth curves.</td>

			<th>Extensions of varieties, the adjunction process for surfaces and maximal extensions of paracanonical curves of genus 6.</th>
			<td>Let \( X \) be a subvariety of \( \mathbb P^n \). An \( e \)-extension \( Y \) is a subvariety of \( \mathbb P^{n+e} \), which is not a cone,
such that there exists a regular sequence \( y_1,\ldots,y_e \) of linear forms for the homogeneous coordinate ring \( S_Y \) of \( Y \) 
such that \( S_Y/(y_1,\ldots,y_e) = S_X \) is the coordinate ring of \( X \).

In this talk I will discribe a computationally easy to use method to compute maximal extensions of certain varieties and illustrate this method by describing maximal extensions of paracanonical curves \( C \) of genus 6.

A paracanonical curve is a curve embedded by a line bundle \( \mathscr L \), which  differs from the canonical bundle
by a topologically trivial line bundle \( \eta \), i.e, an \( \eta \) in \( \operatorname{Pic}^0(C) \). In case of genus 6, the general ones are curves of degree 10 in \( \mathbb P^4 \) with a cubic linear resolution \( S \leftarrow S^{10}(-3) \leftarrow S^{15}(-4) \leftarrow S^6(-5) \leftarrow 0 \).
To identify the smooth 1-extensions \( Y \) in \( \mathbb P^5 \) of \( C \)  we use the adjunction process of Sommese and Van de Ven for surfaces.</td>

		<th>Residue field summands of syzygies via canonical resolutions</th>
		<td>In joint work with Michael DeBellevue, we give extensions of results of Dao and Eisenbud showing the existence of direct summands isomorphic to the residue field in all high syzygies of any module whenever the ring satisfies a certain condition. This implies that some amount of linearity is always present in the resolutions. Our method of proof is via the relative bar resolution of Iyengar and gives some idea of why these summands should exist in such abundance and why they appear from a certain degree onward. In addition, we go on to find an exponential number of these explicitly in the Golod setting using instead the bar resolution formed from A-infinity resolutions due to Burke.</td>

In this talk, I will introduce the Chow-Lam form, which is a generalization of the Chow form to subvarieties of arbitrary Grassmannians. Like the Chow form, it has useful computational properties: for example, it gives us universal formulas for certain linear projections between Grassmannians. Such formulas were pioneered by Thomas Lam for positroid varieties in the study of amplituhedra. This is joint work with Bernd Sturmfels.</td>

		<th>Cohomology of moduli spaces of curves</th>
		<td>The moduli space \( M_g \) of genus g curves (or Riemann surfaces) is a central object of study in algebraic geometry. Its cohomology is important in many fields. For example, the cohomology of \( M_g \) is the same as the cohomology of the mapping class group, and is also related to spaces of modular forms. Using its properties as a moduli space, Mumford defined a distinguished subring of the cohomology of \( M_g \) called the tautological ring. The definition of the tautological ring was later extended to the compactification \( \overline{M_g} \) and the moduli spaces with marked points \( \overline{M_{g,n}} \). While the full cohomology ring of \( \overline{M_{g,n}} \) is quite mysterious, the tautological subring is relatively well understood, and conjecturally completely understood. In this talk, I'll ask the question: which cohomology groups \( H^k(\overline{M_{g,n}}) \) are tautological? And when they are not, how can we better understand them? This is joint work with Samir Canning and Sam Payne.</td>

		<th>Local cohomology of determinantal nullcones</th>
		<td>The coordinate ring  \( R \) of the variety of \( m\times n \) matrices with rank at most \( t \) can be realized in a natural way as an invariant ring of a polynomial ring \( S \); the same is true if one replaces "\( m\times n \) matrices" by "\( n\times n \) symmetric matrices" or "\( n\times n \) alternating matrices". This realization as a ring of invariants explains many of the nice algebraic properties enjoyed by determinantal rings, at least in characteristic zero, since \( R \) is a retract of \( S \) via the Reynolds operator. Motivated by understanding the relationship between \( R \) and \( S \) in arbitrary characteristic, we consider the ideal generated by positive degree invariants \( R_+ \) inside of the ambient polynomial ring \( S \). For example, certain varieties of complexes as introduced by Buchsbaum and Eisenbud occur like so. In this talk, we will discuss some aspects of the behavior of local cohomology with support in these ideals in different characteristics and some applications. This is based on work in progress with Pandey, Singh, and Walther, and earlier joint work with Hochster, Pandey, and Singh.</td>

		<th>Matroidal Polynomials and their Singularities</th>
		<td>(joint with Dan Bath) We introduce a class of polynomials attached to matroids (or flags of matroids) and the choice of a base field that includes various other polynomials that have appeared in the literature, including Kirchhoff polynomials, configuration polynomials, matroid basis polynomials, and multivariable Tutte polynomials. The common property of matroidal polynomials is a Deletion-Contraction formula.

In the talk I will explain various geometric properties of  matroidal polynomials; in particular, for connected matroids they have rational singularities over the complex numbers, and (if homogeneous coming from a single matroid) are \( F \)-regular in positive characteristic. 

The idea of the proof in characteristic zero can be extended to polynomials called Feynman integrands, and which show up in certain integrals in scattering theory. In particular, these do have rational singularities as well under certain genericity hypotheses on masses and momenta. 

The plan is to explain all these words, and hint at the proofs, which involve jets and the Frobenius.</td>

		<td>A classical theorem of Rees tells us that, in an equidimensional and universally catenary Noetherian local ring, two zero-dimensional ideals \( I \subset J \) have the same integral closure if and only if they have the same Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity. This seminal result sparked much interest and has become an important research topic in commutative algebra, singularity theory, and algebraic geometry. For instance, an important consequence is Teissier’s principle of specialization of integral dependence. We will present new criteria for the integrality and birationality of an extension of graded algebras in terms of the general notion of polar multiplicities due to Kleiman and Thorup. We will discuss the behavior in families of ideals of certain invariants studied by Gaffney and Gassler: the polar multiplicities and Segre numbers of ideals. I will report on ongoing joint work with Claudia Polini and Bernd Ulrich. </td>

This last part is joint work with James Cameron, Janina Letz, and Josh Pollitz on something we call Koszul homomorphisms.</td>

		<th>Welschinger Signs and the Wronski Map (New conjectured reality)</th>
		<td>A general real rational plane curve \( C \) of degree \( d \) has \( 3(d-2) \) flexes and \( (d-1)(d-2)/2 \) complex double points. Those double points lying in \( \mathbb{RP}^2 \) are either nodes or solitary points. The Welschinger sign of \( C \) is \( (-1)^s \), where \( s \) is the number of solitary points. When all flexes of \( C \) are real, its parameterization comes from a point on the Grassmannian under the Wronskii map, and every parameterized curve with those flexes is real (this is the Mukhin-Tarasov-Varchenko Theorem). Thus to \( C \) we may associate the local degree of the Wronskii map, which is also \( 1 \) or \( -1 \). My talk will discuss work with Brazelton and McKean towards a possible conjecture that that these two signs associated to \( C \) agree, and the challenges to gathering evidence for this.</td>

We study base change results for Poincare series along a q.c.i. homomorphism in situations that extend results known for complete intersection (c.i.) homomorphisms. The main new result is joint work with Josh Pollitz, and generalizes a well-known result of Shamash for c.i. homomorphisms which makes use of systems of higher homotopies. Our proof develops base change results involving Poincare series over the Koszul complex.</td>

This can be viewed as a categorical version of the Curry-Howard correspondence to extract programs from proofs.</td>

In 1974, Yoshiki Kuramoto proposed a simple, yet surprisingly effective model for oscillators.  We consider homogeneous Kuramoto systems (we will define these notions!).  They are determined from a finite graph.  In this talk, we describe some of what is known about long term behavior of such systems (do the oscillators self-synchronize? or are there other, "exotic" solutions?), and then relate these systems to systems of polynomial equations.  We use algebra, computations in algebraic geometry, and algebraic geometry to study equilibrium solutions to these systems.  We will see how computations using algebraic geometry and my computer algebra system Macaulay2 finds all graphs with at most 8 vertices
(i.e. 8 oscillators) which have exotic solutions.

Note: we assume essentially NO dynamical systems in this talk! The parts of the talk that are new represent joint work with Heather Harrington and Hal Schenck, and also Steve Strogatz and Alex Townsend.</td>

This is continuing joint work with Claudia Polini and Bernd Ulrich.

We will give a brief introduction to licci ideals, discuss where this conjectured bound comes from, why it is useful, and then describe various cases in which we have been able to prove the bound, as time permits. These cases include monomial licci ideals of finite colength, ideals with a maximal regular sequence of quadrics, and licci ideals with nearly pure resolutions.  In the non-homogeneous case, we state a related conjecture and introduce new classes of licci ideals.

The techniques used are varied, including Golod rings, Boij-Soederberg theory, and the Eisenbud-Green-Harris conjecture.</td>

He posited that a Galois group should be `as large as possible' in that it will be the largest group preserving internal symmetry in the geometric problem.

Generalizations of this criterion, under additional hypotheses, have been proven for other toric varieties, for instance by Eisenbud-Erman-Schreyer for products of projective spaces, by Schreyer for Segre-Veronese varieties, and Ottaviani for Grassmannians and quadrics. This talk is about a splitting criterion for arbitrary smooth projective toric varieties, as well as an algorithm for finding indecomposable summands of sheaves and modules in the more general setting of Mori dream spaces.</td>

It has been shown that if two numerical semigroups correspond to points in the same face of \( C_m \), they share many important properties, such as the number of minimal generators and the Betti numbers of their defining toric ideals.  In this way, the faces of the Kunz cones naturally partition the set of all numerical semigroups into "cells" within which any two numerical semigroups have similar algebraic structure.  In this talk, we survey what is known about the face structure of Kunz cones, and how studying Kunz cones can inform the classification of numerical semigroups. </td>

		<th>The embedding theorem in Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory</th>
		<td> Abstract: Brill-Noether theory studies the maps of general curves to projective
spaces. The embedding theorem of Eisenbud and Harris states that a
general degree \(d\) map \(C\) to \(\mathbb P^r\) is an embedding when \(r\) is at least 3.
Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory starts with a curve \(C\) already equipped
with a fixed map \(C\) to \(\mathbb P^1\) (which often forces \(C\) to be special) and
then studies the maps of \(C\) to other projective spaces. In this
setting, the appropriate analogue of the invariants \(d\) and \(r\) is a finer
invariant called the splitting type. Our embedding theorem determines
the splitting types \(\vec{e}\) such that a general map of splitting type
\(\vec{e}\) is an embedding. This is joint work with Kaelin Cook-Powel,
Dave Jensen, Eric Larson, and Isabel Vogt.</td>

		<th>Weyman's generic free resolutions of length three</th>

<td>One approach to studying the structure of finite free resolutions is to construct and analyze universal examples. Unfortunately, Bruns proved that these examples typically do not exist---but they do if one weakens the standard notion of universality to allow for non-unique specialization. Weyman constructed such "generic" examples for length three resolutions, with a careful handling of this non-uniqueness. Moreover, this apparent defect of the construction actually endows the generic example with additional symmetry, from which a surprising connection to the ADE classification arises. I'll explain how this extra symmetry can be leveraged to better understand Weyman's generic example, and some of its applications to linkage and the structure theory of perfect ideals.

		<th>Structures of the derived category on an elliptic curve</th>

In this talk, I will first talk about how and why people use derived categories in algebraic geometry and then I will briefly explain how we can indeed define derived categories. Then, as an example, we will explore the derived category on an elliptic curve. If time permits, I will also compare it with the derived category on a projective line.</td>

		<th>On the maximum genus of space curves</th>
		<td>The study of space curves goes well back into the 19th century, with the great papers of Max Noether and Georges Halphen in 1882. The determination of all possible pairs \((d,g)\) of degree and genus of space curves was correctly stated by Halphen in his paper, but not proved until the work of Gruson and Peskine in 1982. I will focus on just one part of this problem, namely, what is the maximum genus of a space curve of degree \(d\)? In its unadorned form, this question has a simple answer, but when you add consideration of the degree of a surface containing the curve, it is more complicated, and still not completely known. I will discuss the current state of this problem, also known as Halphen’s problem.</td>

		<th>Gorenstein ideals of codimension four</th>
		<td>The structure of Gorenstein ideals of codimension three is described by the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud structure theorem. In codimension four, there is a mostly settled conjecture that such an ideal of deviation two (the simplest non-trivial case) is a hypersurface section of one in codimension three. But such ideals with more generators remain mysterious. Unlike in codimension three, these ideals need not be in the linkage class of a complete intersection (licci). Kustin conjectured that the licci property could be detected by a sequence of "higher order products" generalizing the multiplication on the free resolution of such an ideal, but he only defined a few of these products. I will explain a conjecture, coming from Weyman's work on generic resolutions, that gives a new perspective on the preceding ideas. Then I will explain how similar ideas have been used to investigate previously unexplored territory in codimension three.</td>

		<th>Symmetries on derived categories and reconstruction of elliptic curves</th>
		<td>We know the structure of the derived category of coherent sheaves on an elliptic curve very well and moreover it has been known that an elliptic curve can be reconstructed from categorical structures of its derived category. In this talk, we will discuss a version of reconstruction of elliptic curves that was announced this year, using symmetry of derived categories coming from their autoequivalences. Moreover, if time permits, we will see possible generalization and obstructions to higher dimensional cases, which were discussed in my recent paper in relation with monoidal structures on derived categories.</td>

		<th>Measures of irrationality for hypersurfaces of large degree</th>
		<td>Determining whether a variety is rational is a classical and longstanding problem in birational geometry. A paper by Bastianelli et al. proposes a different angle to this question by considering various measures of irrationality that quantify how far a variety is from being rational. Under this framework, rather than asking whether a variety is rational, it makes sense to ask: what are the values of these measures of irrationality of a variety?
I will outline the proof of the following result of Bastianelli et al.: Let \( \mathrm{irr}(X) \) denote the least degree of dominant rational maps \( X \) to \( \mathbb P^{\dim X} \). Then for \( X \) a very general smooth hypersurface in \( \mathbb P^{n+1} \) of degree \( d \geq 2n+1 \), the irrationality degree \( \mathrm{irr}(X) \) is \( d-1 \), and any rational map achieving the irrationality degree is given by projection from a point if \( d \geq 2n+2 \). This recovers a theorem of M. Noether about the gonality of smooth plane curves. 
The key insight is that positivity of the canonical bundle and Mumford's technique of induced differentials allows us to say the fibers of a dominant map to \( \mathbb P^n \) must lie on a line, which converts the problem to a study of first order line congruences in \( \mathbb P^{n+1} \). In the case of surfaces in \( \mathbb P^3 \) and threefolds in \( \mathbb P^4 \), an earlier paper of Bastianelli, Cortini and de Poi characterizes explicitly which hypersurfaces are not very general in this sense. If time permits, I will also discuss some open problems related to this circle of ideas. We work over the complex numbers throughout.</td>

		<th>Permutohedral complexes and curves with cyclic action</th>
		<td>Although the moduli space of genus-zero curves is not toric, it shares an intriguing amount of the combinatorial structure that a toric variety would enjoy. In fact, by adjusting the moduli problem slightly, one finds a moduli space that is indeed toric, known as Losev—Manin space. The associated polytope is the permutohedron, which has a wealth of other connections: notably, to the structure of the symmetric group and to the combinatorics of matroids. Batyrev and Blume generalized this story by constructing a type-B version of Losev—Manin space whose associated polytope is a signed permutohedron that relates to the group of signed permutations and the combinatorics of delta-matroids. I will discuss joint work with C. Damiolini, C. Eur, D. Huang, S. Li, and R. Ramadas in which we carry out the next stage of generalization, defining a family of moduli spaces of rational curves with \( \mathbb{Z}_r \)-action that can be encoded by a "permutohedral complex" for a more general complex reflection group, and which relates to the combinatorics of multimatroids.</td>

This talk will be a crash course in answering such questions!</td>

Over the years, this statement has been generalized a number of times; the subject of this talk will be describing and proving the much stronger Bruns-Eisenbud-Evans Principal Ideal Theorem. In addition, we will recall the fundamentals of determinantal ideals, ideals generated by the \( t \times t \) minors of an \( m \times n \) matrix over \( R \), and discuss Bruns’ sharpening of the Eagon-Northcott bound in the special case \( I_t(\phi) \neq R \) with \( I_{t+1}(\phi) = 0\).</td>

Finally, I will discuss why nevertheless, affine-locality holds in dimension 1 and (assuming smoothness) in dimension 2.</td>
